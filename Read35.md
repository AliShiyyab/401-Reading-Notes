# Graph

## Declerations 

>**A `Graph` is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. A graph consists of 4 Types:**

* **Vertices**
* **Edges**
* **Directed Graph**
* **UnDirected Graph**

The Way to do the Graph as a Code:

>**Adjacency Matrix** Like when i have 6 node i need to 36 cells and shown the connection between nodes like `2D array`.

>**Adjacency List** An array of lists is used. The size of the array is equal to the number of vertices. Let the array be an array[]. `An entry array[i]` represents the list of vertices adjacent to the `i th` vertex. 


## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected :
* A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
* A connected graph is a graph that has all vertices/nodes that have at least one edge.
* A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

>**A graph with numbers(weights) assigned to its edges.**
