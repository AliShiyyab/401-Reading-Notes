# Android Fundamentals

>**Can be written used:**

* Kotlin
* Java
* C++

>**Components:**

* Activites
* Services
* Broadcast receivers
* Content providers

>**The rest of this document introduces the following concepts:**

* The core framework components that define your app.
* The manifest file in which you declare the components and the required device features for your app.
* Resources that are separate from the app code and that allow your app to gracefully optimize its behavior for a variety of device configurations.

>**Android security features:**

* The Android operating system is a multi-user Linux system in which each app is a different user.
* By default, the system assigns each app a unique Linux user ID (the ID is used only by the system and is unknown to the app).
* Each process has its own virtual machine (VM), so an app's code runs in isolation from other apps.
* By default, every app runs in its own Linux process.
