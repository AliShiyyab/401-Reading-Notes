# Trees

## Main functions and parameter :

* Node Class
* leftChild and rightChild function and parameter
* leafs
* edge
* root

## Binary Tree main three functions:

* PreOrder
* PostOrder
* InOrder

## PreOrder Work:

> **Root -> Left -> Right**

## PostOrder

>**Left -> Root -> Right**

## InOrder

>**Left -> Right -> Root**

## Binary Tree

>*There is no specific sorting order for a binary tree. Nodes can be added into a binary tree wherever space allows.*

## Binary Search Trees

>*A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.*

## Traversal

>**There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:**

1. Depth First 
2. Breadth First
