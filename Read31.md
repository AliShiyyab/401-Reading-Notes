# Espresso "NOT A COFFEE"

>**Used to write a test for Android Studio**

## Works!

* Fast and in a good way.
* Trget audience are the developers
* It lets you leave your waits, syncs, sleeps, and polls behind while it manipulates and asserts on the application UI when it is at rest

>**The message queue is empty. There are no instances of AsyncTask currently executing a task. All developer-defined idling resources are idle. By performing these checks, Espresso substantially increases the likelihood that only one UI action or assertion can occur at any given time. This capability gives you more reliable and dependable test results.**

## Packages!

* **espresso-core** 
* **espresso-web** 
* **espresso-idling-resource** 
* **espresso-contrib** 
* **espresso-intents**
* **espresso-remote**
